                <p>Pack light but smart. Choose breathable clothes suitable for Asia’s often warm and humid weather, and bring modest outfits for temple visits. Comfortable shoes are a must, and don’t forget essentials like a power adapter, reusable water bottle, and small first aid kit.</p>

                <p>Money & Budgeting</p>
                <p>Asia offers incredible value, but it’s best to plan a daily budget. Use ATMs or official exchange counters for good rates, and always carry some local cash since many smaller shops or markets don’t accept cards. Learn local tipping habits and practice polite bargaining where appropriate.</p>

Stick to bottled or filtered water and learn a few key phrases to communicate dietary needs. Respect local dining customs for a more authentic experience.</p>
